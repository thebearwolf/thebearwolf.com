# Library Papers — Source of Truth

Canonical locations for papers. **Use the `/papers/` URLs for sharing** — they stay stable even if Library structure changes.

## Stable public URLs (use these for sharing)

| Paper | URL |
|-------|-----|
| Constructive Thermochemistry | `https://realbearwolf.com/papers/constructive-thermochemistry.pdf` |
| Resource Technology | `https://realbearwolf.com/papers/resource-technology.pdf` |

## File locations

| Paper | PDF file | Page route |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Constructive Thermochemistry | `public/papers/constructive-thermochemistry.pdf` | `src/app/library/constructive-thermochemistry/page.tsx` |
| Resource Technology | `public/papers/resource-technology.pdf` | `src/app/library/resource-technology/page.tsx` |

## When updating a paper

1. Replace the file in `public/papers/` (keep the same filename)
2. The URL stays the same — no link updates needed
